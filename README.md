## Background
This web application is for scheduling employees to work. Employees with credentials can see live schedule changes and they can also be notified via text or email whenever a schedule change is made or if there is an announcement. Employers can get an overview of their employees on the Admin Panel, which shows them all the information of the employees such as: name, phone number, email address, and even their last login date and time.

## Key features
- Employers can view the login times of their employees to ensure people have seen the schedule
- The calendar view can be changed at any time by an administrator
- Weather can be toggled on/off by an administrator and is provides a ten day forecast for the company's location
- Employers can manually reset a user's password if they have forgotten their password and security answer
- A user can be banned––by name or IP address––from creating an account by an employer
- Employers can send email and/or text blasts for regular announcements or schedule updates
- Universal device platform for employers and employees
- Employees can contact their employer or administrator right from the website using a convient form
- Employers are able to control all of their employees, see their sent text messages, and view recent logins from one single screen

## Login
In order to use this application, you must have the required login credentials. This ensures that only authorized individuals use this application.

## Inspiration
I was inspired to create this application because the old scheduling system was a spreadsheet that would be posted on a bulletin board every week. This was obviously not very effective, especially for employees who did not live within the area.

## Feedback
