# Scheduler

## Background
This web application is for scheduling employees to work. Employees with credentials can see live schedule changes and they can also be notified via text or email whenever a schedule change is made or if there is an announcement.

## Login
In order to use this application, you must have the required login credentials. This ensures that only authorized individuals use this application.

## Inspiration
I was inspired to create this application because the old scheduling system was a spreadsheet that would be posted on a bulletin board every week. This was obviously not very effective, especially for employees who did not live within the area.

## Feedback
To become a tester and report issues with this application, please email [me](mailto:zcopland16@gmail.com?Subject=Scheduler%20App).
Any and all suggestions are welcome and encouraged.
