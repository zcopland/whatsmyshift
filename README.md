## Background
This web application is for scheduling employees to work. Employees with credentials can see live schedule changes and they can also be notified via text or email whenever a schedule change is made or if there is an announcement. Employers can get an overview of their employees on the Admin Panel, which shows them all the information of the employees such as: name, phone number, email address, and even their last login date and time.

## Login
In order to use this application, you must have the required login credentials. This ensures that only authorized individuals use this application.

## Inspiration
I was inspired to create this application because the old scheduling system was a spreadsheet that would be posted on a bulletin board every week. This was obviously not very effective, especially for employees who did not live within the area.

## Feedback
To become a tester and report issues with this application, please email [me](mailto:zcopland16@gmail.com?Subject=WhatsMyShift%20App).
Any and all suggestions are welcomed and encouraged.
